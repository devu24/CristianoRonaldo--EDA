## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cristiano Ronaldo Data

### Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to Cristiano Ronaldo. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help in understanding the data better before proceeding to more complex modeling techniques. The EDA process includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to identify relationships, outliers, and underlying structures within the data.

### Process and Techniques

#### 1. **Data Collection**

   - The dataset was collected from [mention the source if applicable].
   - It contains various attributes related to Cristiano Ronaldo, such as goals scored, matches played, assists, and other performance metrics.

#### 2. **Data Cleaning**

   - **Handling Missing Values:** Checked for any missing values and handled them appropriately using techniques like imputation, deletion, or interpolation.
   - **Removing Duplicates:** Ensured there were no duplicate records in the dataset.
   - **Outlier Detection:** Identified and treated outliers using statistical methods like Z-score or IQR.
   - **Data Formatting:** Ensured all data types were correct, and formatted dates, strings, and numerical values consistently.

#### 3. **Descriptive Statistics**

   - **Summary Statistics:** Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other summary statistics for each numerical feature.
   - **Frequency Distribution:** Analyzed the frequency distribution of categorical variables to understand the distribution of data.
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Computed correlation coefficients to identify relationships between different numerical variables.

#### 4. **Data Visualization**

   - **Histograms:** Created histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variables like goals scored per season, assists, etc.
   - **Box Plots:** Used box plots to identify the spread and outliers within the data.
   - **Scatter Plots:** Plotted scatter plots to explore relationships between two numerical variables, such as goals vs. assists.
   - **Heatmaps:** Generated heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix and identify highly correlated features.
   - **Time Series Analysis:** If applicable, performed time series analysis on data related to performance over time.

#### 5. **Feature Engineering**

   - **Creating New Features:** Derived new features from existing data, such as goal-per-match ratio, assist-per-match ratio, etc.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converted categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

#### 6. **Insights and Findings**

   - Summarized key insights derived from the data, such as trends in performance over different seasons, impact of certain factors on goal-scoring ability, etc.
   - Highlighted any surprising findings or patterns that were not immediately obvious.

#### 7. **Conclusion**

   - Provided a conclusion based on the analysis, suggesting potential areas for further analysis or modeling.
   - Discussed any limitations of the analysis and how they might be addressed in future work.

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python:** The entire EDA was performed using Python.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Utilized for creating various visualizations.
- **Scipy & Statsmodels:** Used for performing statistical analysis.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cristiano-ronaldo-eda.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
